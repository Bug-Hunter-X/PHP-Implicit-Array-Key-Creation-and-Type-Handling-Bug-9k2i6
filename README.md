This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to implicit array key creation when using pass-by-reference. The `increment_array_value` function is designed to increment the value associated with a given key in an array.  However, if the key's type doesn't match the existing array keys, PHP silently adds a new key-value pair instead of throwing an error. This can lead to unexpected and hard-to-debug issues. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach that checks for the key's existence and type, ensuring that the function behaves predictably.
